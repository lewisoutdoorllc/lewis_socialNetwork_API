# Description
  [Social Network API](https://github.com/lewisoutdoorllc/lewis_socialNetwork_API)

 Lewis Social Network API was built to be an API for a social network web application where users can share there thoughts, react to friends thoughts, and create a friends list. We used Express.js for the routing and a MongoDB database along with the Mongoose ODM. Moment.js was used for the date and timestamps.
